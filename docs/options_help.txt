-mode
    Description:-
        Set the mode of the program. Choose from
        1. train
            Trains the FNN on all 60k images.

            eg :- ./recog -mode train
        2. test_all
            Tests on all 10k images

            eg :- ./recog -mode test_all
        3. test_single
            Tests on the MNIST images one by one while showing each image
            and its original label.

            eg :- ./recog -mode test_single
        4. test_draw
            Draw a digit on an OpenGL window

            eg :- ./recog -mode test_draw

-e
    Description:-
        Set the number of total epochs to be done

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -e 200

-b
    Description:-
        Set the batch size.

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -b 50

-l
    Description:-
        Used to set the learning rate of the training

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -l 0.1

-decay
    Description:-
        Set the decay rate. The program uses step decay method.

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -decay 0.75

-dropout
    Description:-
        Set the epoch dropout value for step decay

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -dropout 3

-layers
    Description:-
        Set the number of and sizes of hidden layers of the FNN

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -layers 2 200 60

        The above command will create an FNN of 2 hidden layer of which
        the first layer will contain 200 neurons and the second will have
        60 neurons
        The sizes of the input and output layers are not changeable.

-name
    Description:-
        Set the name of the FNN

        eg :- ./recog -mode train -name my_fnn

        The above command makes a new FNN called "my_fnn" if it doesn't 
        already exists or uses the FNN called "my_fnn" if it is there in
        the saved_FNN folder.

Note:-  in case the other hyperparameters are not given during the training 
        mode, some default values are given to the FNN.
